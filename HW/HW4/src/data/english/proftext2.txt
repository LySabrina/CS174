This will look in the data folder of the project and will make one quiz data file for each subfolder of data. The name of the quiz should be the name of the subfolder followed by .txt . So an english subfolder would get an english.txt quiz data file. A quiz data file should be a serialized, associative array consisting of word => [number of occurrences of word in documents in folder, [array of 5-grams word appeared in as the middle word]] pairs. To generate a quiz data file, QuizMaker.php should read each .txt file in a subfolder of data. For each such file, it read in the file to a string, strip any HTML/XML tags, and lower case this string. Then it should split the file into sentences according to a list of common sentence terminating symbols (for example, .!?). Any remaining punctuation should next be removed from a sentence. For each word in each sentence in the file, the number of occurrences of the word should be added to the appropriate entry in the associative array. Further, each five word-gram in the sentence should be added to the appropriate entry in the array. For example, if the sentence was: "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog." The word "the" is the middle word for two 5 word-grams: ([blank] [blank] the quick brown) and (jumped over the lazy dog). We would add each to the entry for the word "the" in the associative array. Once done processing all the text files in a folder, the associative array should be sorted from most frequently occurring word to least before serializing and writing it to the quiz file.
