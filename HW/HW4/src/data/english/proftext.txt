Once upon a time, there was a CS 174 professor who was walking around the block trying not to step in dog poop and pondering deep questions of the universe. He was thinking it is not too hard to determine the most common words in a language by just counting words in some corpus for that language such as a Wikipedia dump. On the other hand, it seems harder to track down for each word in a language what fraction of native speakers know that word? Mmmm, he thought, this seems like a job for those intrepid CS 174 coders and the internet to solve. Students can make a command line tool QuizMaker.php to make quizzes based on a folders of text files, and make a web app where the denizens of the web can take theses quizzes and have their scores tallied.
