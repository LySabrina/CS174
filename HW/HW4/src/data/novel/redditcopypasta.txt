This is what happens when the community prays to Neow! Perfect draw!

[[claw]] him, then [[self repair]], then claw again.

Claw should always be the first and last thing you do each day. It’s the LAW

Edit regarding the happy flower discussion: Flower on 2 is almost certainly better than flower on 0 for two reasons:

it will likely produce more energy over the course of the fight.

Flower on 0 might help against the double attack of cloistered guardian if we break him turn 1, but if we break him turn 2, it procs on the single attack turn (hits for 10) and with our low block deck, we likely aren’t playing extra attacks that turn. Flower on 2 on the other hand either falls on a whirlwind turn, or on a double attack turn.
